This repository contains the code and the visualisations for the project of the Planning and Decision Making course (RO47005) of the Master Robotics at the TU Delft. The aim of this project is to use path finding algorithms to find collision free paths for a robot in a simulation environment to follow. During this project, RRT and RRT* algorithms were used for the path finding. The path was than followed by a non-holonomic differential drive mobile robot with the use of a PID controller.

## Requirements
matplotlib==3.6.2  
numpy==1.24.1  
scipy==1.10.0  
tqdm==4.64.1  
[CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads)  

## Running the software

1. Download [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads)  
2. Clone the repository  
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DennizGoren/PlanningDecisionMaking.git
    ```  
3. Install required packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up a ```PYTHONPATH``` environment variable to link the CoppeliaSim API to the repository
    ```sh
   export PYTHONPATH=~/Applications/coppeliaSim.app/Contents/Resources/programming/zmqRemoteApi/clients/python
   ```
5. Load the ```scene.ttt``` file into the CoppeliaSim environment by going to File -> Open scene...
6. Make sure that there is not an active simulation in CoppeliaSim and run the following for RRT* to find a path and the simulation to start
    ```sh 
    python RobotControl.py 
    ```

## Results

On the left we see the RRT* path finding algorithm creating paths for 4000 iterations. The paths are found based on the configuration of the simulation environment on the right.

The shortest path that was found by the alogorithm is depicted in red in left image. On the right we see the robot executing this path in the simulation environment.
